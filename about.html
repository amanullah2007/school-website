            <h2>Our History :</h2>
            <p>Founded in 1985 by Dr. Elizabeth Mitchell, Excelsior Academy began with just 50 students and 5 dedicated teachers. Our founders envisioned a school that would challenge traditional educational paradigms and create a nurturing environment where students could truly thrive.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Over the years, we've grown into a leading educational institution with state-of-the-art facilities, exceptional faculty, and a community of over 800 students. Throughout our evolution, we've remained true to our founding principles while continuously adapting to prepare students for an ever-changing world.
